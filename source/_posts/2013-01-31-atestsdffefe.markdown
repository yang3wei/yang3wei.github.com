D:\RoboCup\Dev\TinMan>git push rubix master
To ssh://dnoakes@rubix/volume1/git/TinMan
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://dnoakes@rubix/volume1/git/TinMan'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes before pushing again.  See the 'Note about
fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
I've read through the documentation on git push but at this 
point I can't understand why I'm seeing this problem.

Here is some other contextual info:

D:\RoboCup\Dev\TinMan>git --version
git version 1.7.0.2.msysgit.0

D:\RoboCup\Dev\TinMan>git branch
* (no branch)
  master
